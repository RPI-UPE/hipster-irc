hipster-irc
===========

I want to create a messaging system similar to HipChat, or Jaconda that can be self hosted. So this is where that shall happen.

Why
===

I used Jaconda's free plan to coordinate with two other students who were working with me on the programming competition website. I found the process to be really efficient and want a piece of software that I can host myself.

Also I want to learn Erlang, and this seems like a perfect opportunity fit for Erlang's features.
I started off wit [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com) by Frederic Trottier-Hebert. This book was inspired off a fantastic book that I picked up Haskell through [Learn You a Haskell for great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), so I figured I'd read it. Seems like a good introduction.
